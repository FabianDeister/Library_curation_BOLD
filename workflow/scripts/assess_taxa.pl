# NOTE: the query below now fetches ALL taxa in the normalized taxa table as produced by

# not the BOLD record. Hence, in this script we iterate through the taxa, not the barcodes.
# Nevertheless, this particular query needs further refinement:
# - We only care to do this for species where the barcodes are top 3 in quality grading,
# - We only want to assess proper species, not provisional names or 'sp.' epithets,
# - For BGE we only care about those species that are in the target list.
# Meeting those requirements will involve a combination of things, such as getting the
# gap list cleaned up and linked to the database, pre-filtering the input data on curation
# quality, and refining the search predicates in the construct below:
